"""
Victor alternatives not meant for production use, but for testing and debugging.

* ``Mictor``: MCS hack for negative benchmarking: Victor with MCSMerger, i.e. no positional info used.
* ``Wictor``: Victor without pyrosetta, i.e. no energy minimization.
* ``AccountableBRICS``: Not a Victor, but generates a BRICS decomposition of the hits and returns a dataframe
    with the built molecules usable in ``Laboratory.place``.
* ``FreeVictor``: Victor with no constraints.
* ``SingleVictor``: Victor with only one hit used for constraints.

To run in ``Laboratory`` class set the ``.Victor`` attribute to the desired ``Victor`` alternative.

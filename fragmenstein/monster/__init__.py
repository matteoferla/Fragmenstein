This is Monster proper. and contains the class ``Monster``.
The inheritance is as follows:


**_MonsterCombine**  inherits:

* ``_MonsterMerge``  (``_MonsterCommunal`` <- ``_MonsterTracker`` <- ``_MonsterBase``)
* ``_MonsterRing``

**_MonsterPlace**  inherits:

* ``_MonsterMerge``  (``_MonsterBlend`` < - ``_MonsterCommunal`` <- ``_MonsterTracker`` <- ``_MonsterBase``)

**_MonsterUtils** inherits

* ``_MonsterCommunal``  ( <- ``_MonsterTracker`` <- ``_MonsterBase``) 
* ``GPM``

Where:

**_MonsterBase** adds the cvars and the ``__init__`` and its dependent methods

**_MonsterTracker** inherits ``_MonsterBase`` and adds just a method to better store modifications

**_MonsterCommunal** inherits ``_MonsterTracker`` ( <- ``_MonsterBase``)


It adds methods for misc purposes beyond place/combine.
It is inherited by ``Monster`` only.

class Monster(_MonsterUtil, _MonsterPlace, _MonsterCombine):
    """
    This creates a stitched together monster.
    For initilialisation for either placing or combining, it needs a list of hits (rdkit.Chem.Mol).

    Note, the hits have to be 3D embedded as present in the protein —it would defeat the point otherwise!
    For a helper method to extract them from crystal structures see `Victor.extract_mol`.

    The calculation are done either by place or merge.

    ## Place

    >>> monster.place(mol)

    Given a RDKit molecule and a series of hits it makes a spatially stitched together version
    of the initial molecule based on the hits.
    The reason is to do place the followup compound to the hits as faithfully as possible
    regardless of the screaming forcefields.

    * ``.mol_options`` are the possible equiprobable alternatives.
    * ``.positioned_mol`` is the desired output (rdkit.Chem.Mol object)
    * ``.initial_mol`` is the input (rdkit.Chem.Mol object), this is `None` in a `.combine` call.
    * ``.modifications['scaffold']`` is the combined version of the hits (rdkit.Chem.Mol object).
    * ``.modifications['chimera']`` is the combined version of the hits, but with differing atoms made \
                    to match the followup (rdkit.Chem.Mol object).

    ``.get_positional_mapping``, which works also as a class method,
    creates a dictionary of mol_A atom index to mol_B atom index
    based on distance (cutoff 2&Aring;) and not MCS.

    The code works in two broad steps, first a scaffold is made, which is the combination of the hits (by position).
    Then the followup is placed. It is not embedded with constrained embedding functionality of RDKit as this
    requires the reference molecule to have a valid geometry, which these absolutely do not have this.
    Novel side chains are added by aligning an optimised conformer against the closest 3-4 reference atoms.
    Note that ``.initial_mol`` is not touched. ``.positioned_mol`` may have lost some custom properties,
    but the atom indices are the same.

    If an atom in a Chem.Mol object is provided via ``attachment`` argument and the molecule contains a dummy atom.
    Namely element R in mol file or * in string.

    ## Combine

    >>> monster.combine(keep_all=True, collapse_rings=True, joining_cutoff= 5))

    Combines the hits by merging and linking. ``collapse_rings`` argument results in rings being collapsed
    before merging to avoid oddities.
    The last step within the call is fixing any oddities of impossible chemistry via the call ``rectify``.
    This uses the separate class ``Rectifier`` to fix it.

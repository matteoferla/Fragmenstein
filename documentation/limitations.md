## Number of parent hits

The algorithm is not flexible in respect to parent hits: it does not arbitrarily mix and match:
the user needs to do that.
There are some steps taken to discard atoms that are red herrings etc., but these are limited.
If you have a compound and don't know which of a 100 parent hits was the parent hit,
place iteratively the compound and pick the best, don't run all 100 parent hits as a single job.
